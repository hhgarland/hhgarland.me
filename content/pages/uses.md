I have been using Linux daily since 2009. Like most people in the field of information technology, I've used Microsoft Windows on a daily basis as well. I have tried moving to Wayland off and on with ~~Sway and~~ Hyprland, but I always find myself tinkering too much. Dwm gives me everything I need in a window manager, where I can just compile the source code and get to work.
